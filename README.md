# Program Generator

*This project was for Comp 550, Fall 2018. It is a basic natural language parser that generates code in various languages.*

---

The following repo contains the source code for our program generator.

Note that `app.py` and `cmd.py` are meant to be means to interface with the code without reloading the entire program each time.

As we switched our implementation part way through, we have not hooked the methods back in those files. All the actual logic, as well as runnable tests, can be found in the `generator` folder.

All code was tested through PyCharm, and requires Python >= 3.7
