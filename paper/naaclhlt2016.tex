\begin{abstract}
  When learning new programming languages, it is often easy to understand the syntax and learn
  about idiomatic executions through examples. Particularly with different paradigms, how we
  write code in one language may not be one to one with code in another language. Most
  languages provide examples through a list of common executions. If we can instead provide an
  example matching simple instructions in English, we can help refine the amount of code
  a new developer has to go through, and assist in creating an infinite set of examples tailored to
  each user. In this work, we have developed a prototype system which is able to process natural language instructions
  related to list creation with optional conditions, which is then translated into executable code with programming language provided by the user.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Learning the syntax of a programming language can be frustrating and challenging. 
For a new developer, programming languages contain lots of domain-specific rules, varying in control structures, syntax, etc.
For experienced developers, programming languages may introduce completely new paradigms, and may not be easily translated from known languages through one to one mappings of keywords.
One way to help overcome this technical hurdle is to read official documentation, or a large set of common examples.
However, this is often a big time investment for a user who just wants to explore the basics of a language.
Moreover, the examples may not completely reflect the desired use case, and can often be irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Our goal is to explore the feasibility of mapping natural languages to programs by extracting features and creating runnable code.
This would greatly reduce the learning curve when dealing with simple operations, and will help introduce language features without the developer knowing about them beforehand.
More specifically, we wish to focus on generating number lists in multiple programming languages, allowing for varying constraints available across all supported languages.
We will use Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to create a tree representing the logic, then introduce language specific transformers to map subtrees to working code.
Lastly, we will pass through the generated body and output a working program.
On top of being able to create a program, we wish to introduce a structure that can be extended to support both new languages and new operations within the semantics tree.

% TODO should we give an example?
% Main goal of intro is to have the hypothesis, which is above   

\section{General Instructions}
 

\textbf{References}:  We recommend
including references in a separate~{\small\texttt .bib} file, and include an example file 
in this release ({\small\tt naalhlt2016.bib}).  Some commands
for names with accents are provided for convenience in Table \ref{tab:accents}.  
References stored in the separate~{\small\tt .bib} file are inserted into the document using the following commands:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{naaclhlt2016}
\bibliographystyle{naaclhlt2016}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize 

References should appear under the heading {\bf References} at the 
end of the document, but before any Appendices, unless the appendices contain references.  
Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.  %This behavior is provided by default in the provided \BibTeX\ style ({\small\tt naaclhlt2016.bst}). 
Provide as complete a reference as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Authors' full names rather than initials are preferred.  You may use
{\bf standard} abbreviations for conferences\footnote{\scriptsize {\tt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ \\ \-\hspace{.75cm} List\_of\_computer\_science\_conference\_acronyms}} and journals\footnote{\tt http://www.abbreviations.com/jas.php}.




{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\textbf{Acknowledgment} sections should go as a last (unnumbered) section immediately
before the references.  


\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page. They may
be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the
line separating the footnotes from the text.}  Footnotes should be in 9 point font.

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns and should be placed at
the top of a page. Color illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that 
they will be understandable when printed in black ink. 

\begin{table}
\small
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}
\hline \bf Type of Text & \bf Font Size & \bf Style \\ \hline
paper title & 15 pt & bold \\
author names & 12 pt & bold \\
author affiliation & 12 pt & \\
the word ``Abstract'' & 12 pt & bold \\
section titles & 12 pt & bold \\
document text & 11 pt  &\\
abstract text & 10 pt & \\
captions & 9 pt & \\
caption label & 9 pt & bold \\
bibliography & 10 pt & \\
footnotes & 9 pt & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide.}
\end{table}

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``{\bf Figure 1:} Figure caption.'', ``{\bf Table 1:} Table caption.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 9 point text.  Table and Figure labels should be bold-faced.

\subsection{Accessibility}
\label{ssec:accessibility}

In an effort to accommodate the color-blind (as well as those printing
to paper), grayscale readability for all accepted papers will be
encouraged.  Color is not forbidden, but authors should ensure that
tables and figures do not rely solely on color to convey critical
distinctions.

\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

The NAACL HLT 2016 main conference accepts submissions of long papers and short papers.  Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to 9 pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.  Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references.  For both long and short papers, all illustrations and appendices must be accommodated within these page limits, observing the formatting instructions given in the present document.  Papers that do not conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are subject to be rejected without review.


\section{Double-blind review process}
\label{sec:blind}

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the
authors' names and affiliations.  Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., ``We previously showed (Smith,
1991) ...'' must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ``Smith
previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'' Papers that do not conform to
these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition,
please do not post your submissions on the web until after the
review process is complete (in special cases this is permitted: see 
the multiple submission policy below).

We will reject without review any papers that do not follow the
official style guidelines, anonymity conditions and page limits.

\section{Multiple Submission Policy}

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must indicate this at submission time. Authors of
papers accepted for presentation at NAACL HLT 2016 must notify the
program chairs by the camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper
will be presented. All accepted papers must be presented at the
conference to appear in the proceedings. We will not accept for
publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in
content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published
elsewhere.

Preprint servers such as arXiv.org and ACL-related workshops that
do not have published proceedings in the ACL Anthology are not
considered archival for purposes of submission. Authors must state
in the online submission form the name of the workshop or preprint
server and title of the non-archival version.  The submitted version
should be suitably anonymized and not contain references to the
prior non-archival version. Reviewers will be told: ``The author(s)
have notified us that there exists a non-archival previous version
of this paper with significantly overlapping text. We have approved
submission under these circumstances, but to preserve the spirit
of blind review, the current submission does not reference the
non-archival version.'' Reviewers are free to do what they like with
this information.

Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL HLT must ensure
that submissions do not overlap significantly ($>25\%$) with each other
in content or results. Authors should not submit short and long
versions of papers with substantial overlap in their original
contributions.
